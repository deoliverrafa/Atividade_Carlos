        Mama, take this badge off of me
        I can't use it anymore
        It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
        I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
        Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
        Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
        Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
        Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
        Mama, put my guns in the ground
        I can't shoot them anymore
        That long black cloud is comin' down
        I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
        Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
        Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
        Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
        Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
